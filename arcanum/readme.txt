== Description ==

Acranum is a fresh and colorful theme which expands on the already superb Esotera. The plethora of features and timeless love for gradients are still here, with a little twist. Responsiveness, Search Engine Optimization, a light framework and WooCommerce support are the pillars on which great design and clean typography flourish. And as always, the level of customization is unmatched.
